## ML,Dl and object detection and related approach and everything add here: 
1. https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdmb/2018/4546896/  (faster rcnn and improved for small objects)
2. https://github.com/Aakash-kaushik/image_classification/blob/master/Scripts/scrape_modak.py
   -(https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
4. SuperResolution library: https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution
5. face detection (jis camera ne detect kiya sirf us camera ko he scan karenge jab user reqest dalega and can do a extensive serach agr unme bhi nahi milla toh)
6. because companies don't have a large dataset of a single employee (https://towardsdatascience.com/one-shot-learning-face-recognition-using-siamese-neural-network-a13dcf739e)
7. mmdetection chal gaya 
8. objects not in dataset, look google form responses

## for the user interaction part and server side part add here:
Server side for  - handling video feed @(gaurav)
		 - user interaction (when the user inputs something it should show the list of items matching to what the user has typed) @(satyam)
		 - encryption(superficial - access for admin)
		 - data transfer for the request
		 - returning the result(only if necessary send a  frame of video /image) 

## for the  overall ordered workflow of the application:
        0.keeping track of the person and recording the time-stamp
	1.search request from the user 
	2.server requesting the system for the video feed 
	3.priority-vise checking of the cameras where the person stayed longer (using face detection), terminate the serach if found else continue to the remaining cameras.
	4.if the object is found after all this keep a track on the object till the user takes it back 
	5.if not found do periodic scans till a period of time suppose for one day after each hour so like for 24 times in a day and then stop.
