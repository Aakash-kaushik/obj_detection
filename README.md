### Guide: 
* You first need to install mmdetection, instructions are given [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md)
* Then, you need to [download](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md) the checkpoint and choose the config file accoridng to the model you wish to use from the mmdetection model.
* We used the "cascade_rcnn_x101_64x4d_fpn_1x" pre trained model.
* After that move the contents of this repo to the mmdetection directory that you cloned and change the variables in the slack_bot.py file accordingly to access the model and config file from mmdetection you wish to use.
* The slack_bot.py file contains the basic command you can add according to your use and requires a bot token before you can start using it.
* dark_img_tool.py contains tools to detect dark image and to enhance, but we weren't able to make the dark image detector functions work.
